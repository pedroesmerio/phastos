# Phastos CLI

This is an CLI that I create to use it as a creator of things I already have solved.

The name is Phastos because I am immerged on the UCM and yes it is ispired on the Eternal god of Marvel Universe.

## What is my purpose with this project?

I don't wanna to transform this project futurally in a open source project. My real purpose with this it is to reuse some logic that I already have solved. That and to have fun creating something new (what happen that we stop to make code just for fun?).

## How to use it
You can just install it cloning this repo and creating a link to you computer execute this code

### Install
```shell
$git clone https://github.com/pedroesmerio/phastos.git

### Using the CLI

To use this CLI just execute in your terminal the command:

```shell

//Welcome to the phastos CLI
```
### Whats I already made?

That's the Second commit that I made, so there's nothing here yet, =D 

But I got some things on mind

- [ ] Components to streamline de React workflow
- [ ] Arithmetics Calculations (percentage, cross-multiplication)

If you got some ideas it will be welcomed. Just Create an issue.
